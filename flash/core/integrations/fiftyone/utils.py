    This method can be used in all of the following environments:

    -   **Local Python shell**: The App will launch in a new tab in your
        default web browser.
    -   **Remote Python shell**: Pass the ``remote=True`` option to this method
        and then follow the instructions printed to your remote shell to open
        the App in your browser on your local machine.
    -   **Jupyter notebook**: The App will launch in the output of your current
        cell.
    -   **Google Colab**: The App will launch in the output of your current
        cell.
    -   **Python script**: Pass the ``wait=True`` option to block execution of
        your script until the App is closed.

    See :ref:`this page <fiftyone:environments>` for more information about
    using the FiftyOne App in different environments.

    Args:
        predictions: Can be either a list of FiftyOne labels that will be
            matched with the corresponding ``filepaths``, or a list of
            dictionaries with "filepath" and "predictions" keys that contains
            the filepaths and predictions.
        filepaths: A list of filepaths to images or videos corresponding to the
            provided ``predictions``.
        label_field: The name of the label field in which to store the
            predictions in the FiftyOne dataset.
        wait: Whether to block execution until the FiftyOne App is closed.
        **kwargs: Optional keyword arguments for
